                <li> Investigated the relationship between Dark Triad personality traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy)
                    and serial killer behavior through a comprehensive literature review and analysis of case studies. </li>
                <li> Found significant correlations between high levels of Dark Triad traits and the likelihood of engaging in serial
                    killing behavior, contributing to the understanding of criminal psychology. </li>
            </ul>
            <li> "The Impact of Childhood Trauma on Adult Attachment Styles" - Undergraduate Research Project - Northeastern State University - December 2020 </li>
            <ul>
                <li> Explored how various forms of childhood trauma influence adult attachment styles using surveys and psychological assessments. </li>
                <li> Results indicated that individuals with a history of childhood trauma were more likely to develop insecure attachment styles,
                    highlighting the long-term effects of early adverse experiences. </li>
